Compile model by running 'make' in driver/ directory

This version of the NWS model code (Snow17, Sac, UH) was cobbled together to run as a forecasting model.  
It runs a single watershed that can have multiple zones, which are separately routed using a unit hydrograph scheme
in which the UH is specied as a 2 parameter gamma distribution

AWW: modified:  minor code changes to allow compilation with gfortran
AWW: modified:  code changes to use external PET in forcings
AWW: Jan'16 :  runs multiple models in loop and combines outputs (weighted areal average)
AWW-20160823:  streamlined HRU functionality, removed unused code and subroutines, corrected bug in param read   
               streamlined inputs as well (now only one namelist, as arg; 3 param files; forcings)
AWW-20161115:  revised the state file write and read functionality to be consistent -- can now directly read the
               state files that have been written by a prior run
