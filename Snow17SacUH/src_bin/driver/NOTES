something odd about the program -- if don't have print statement after reading forcings, 
they become corrupted somehow

BUG:  when compiling with gfortran, there are big meltoff events whenever temps get above zero
      -- as if the rain heat is not represented correctly

      with PGF it seems fine -- need to diagnose
